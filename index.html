        <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <p>Hello! My name is Amber Kim. As you can see in my education and experience below, I took a bit of a round-a-bout way towards my journey as a Web Developer.</p>
          <p>After graduating from the University of Washington, I moved with my husband to his next station duty in Camp Lejeune, NC. From there I tried to build a business doing photography and videography but it did not quite work because of all the deployments and relocation.</p>
          <p>Before my second child was born and before my husband left the military, I was introduced by another military wife to working online for small businesses helping them remotely with whatever tech and marketing help they needed. Eventually I honed in to the tasks I really enjoyed which was building websites and web pages with WordPress using design tools but eventually I wanted to learn more and have more freedom to design websites from the ground up as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
